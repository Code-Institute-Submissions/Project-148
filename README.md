## Further Comments
- There are limited comments on the development as i had originally started the project in a diffent file witch can be found on my github page
- I know that this project is not up the scatch. I had a lot of personal issues over the last couple of months with i let get in the way of my studies. I'm quite upset about this but i know that i can develop a better functioning site. I am going to keep working on this project for my portfolio and hopefully get it to a place where i am happy eith it. I am sorry that I didnt create a working version of this site. I will focus more on my studies in the future and not let my personal life get in the way.
